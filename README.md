# SLTL - Master's Thesis

This repository contains the code and experiments conducted as part of my Master's thesis.

## Setup

1. **Unzip the dataset**:
   Before running the evaluation script, make sure to unzip the `datasets` folder.

2. **Set up the virtual environment**:
   If you have a virtual environment, activate it. Otherwise, install the required packages directly to your local interpreter using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
